# Ex.No:1(E)  STATIC VARIABLE

## AIM:
To write a Java program that divides the number 3210 by 3, takes the modulus of the quotient with 6, multiplies the result by 10, and displays the final result.

## ALGORITHM :
1.Start the program.
2.Declare and initialize an integer variable num = 3210.
3.Divide num by 3 and store the result in a variable called quotient.
4.Find the modulus of quotient with 6 and store it in modResult.
5.Multiply modResult by 10 and store it in finalResult.
6.Print finalResult.
7.End the program.
